## 802.11b
* 2.4 GHz frequencies in the ISM radio band
* considered legacy because it requires the channel it's operating on to shift from newer modulation techniques to direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation

## 802.11a
* 5 GHz frequencies in the U-NII radio band
* orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation
* considered legacy due to limited number of non-overlapping frequency channels

## 802.11g
* updated standard for 802.11b
* 2.4 GHz frequencies in the ISM radio band
* OFDM modulation

## 802.11n
* operates on the 2.4 GHz frequencies in the ISM radio band and the 5 GHz frequencies in the U-NII radio band
* introduced multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technology and channel bonding
* uses OFDM modulation along with multiple input, multiple output (MIMO), called MIMO-OFDM

## 802.11ac
* current gold standard for wireless
* operates on the 5 GHz frequencies of the U-NII radio band and ISM
* uses MIMO-OFDM modulation

## 802.11ax
* expected to replace 802.11ac as the gold standard for wireless
* marketed as WiFi 6 by the Wi-Fi Alliance
* operates on the 5 GHz frequencies of the U-NII radio band and can also operate on the 2.4 GHz radio band, unlike 802.11ac
* In the future, the 802.11ax standard will operate on 6 GHz radio frequencies, and it has been dubbed WiFi 6E
* will use MIMO-OFDM modulation
